### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Converted web developer, a journey rich in experience and learning:

My curious and exploratory nature prompted me to travel whenever I had the chance. This allowed me to discover ways of life and working cultures from several countries (France, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong).

It is again these character traits and the search for new challenges, which pushed me to reorient myself towards the profession of web developer, a constantly evolving environment, which fully suits my personality.

I started by training myself, then I followed an intensive training within the organization Le Wagon. At the end of this training I had the opportunity to work on React projects as a freelance.
